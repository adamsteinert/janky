A prototype Jenkins status viewer for windows written in WPF.  It will sit in your toolbar and periodically check your server of choice to ensure all jobs are healthy.

This was purely meant as a prototype to bootstrap a different project.  The code is pretty nappy, and it is feature poor.  Just fair warning ;)
